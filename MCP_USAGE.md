# üöÄ TikTok Business API MCP Usage Guide

## Overview

This guide provides practical examples and reference material for using the TikTok Business API MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It's designed for users who have the server installed and want to interact with it through an MCP client.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Before using these tools, ensure you have completed the following setup:

1. **Installed the Package**: The server should be installed via `pip`. If you haven't done this, refer to the `README.md` for instructions.
2. **Configured Credentials**: A `.env` file with your TikTok API credentials must exist in the project's root directory.
3. **Connected MCP Client**: Your MCP client (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) should be configured to connect to the server.

      "command": "tiktok-ads-mcp",

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "command not found: tiktok-ads-mcp"

This means the package was not installed correctly or your terminal's path is not configured to find packages installed by pip. Ensure you have run `pip install -e .` from the project root.

### Authentication Errors

Run `get_auth_info()` to see the status of your loaded credentials. Most issues can be traced to an incorrect or expired key in your `.env` file.

### No Data Returned

For `get_insights`, double-check that your date range is valid and that campaigns were active during that period.
